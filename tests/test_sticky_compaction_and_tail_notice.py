"""
Tests for the two-part cache-stability fix in SimpleContextManager:

(a) Notice placement: the compaction notice must be appended at the TAIL of
    the returned message list (never inserted into the prefix), with
    role="user" (not "system") and metadata={"ephemeral": True}, so that:
      - every provider's caching (explicit breakpoints or automatic prefix
        matching) sees a stable prefix across calls, and
      - the Anthropic provider's ephemeral walk-back logic
        (_count_trailing_ephemeral_messages) actually recognizes and skips it
        -- which requires role != "system" (system-role messages never reach
        the "conversation" list the walk-back operates on at all) AND
        metadata.ephemeral=True on a TRAILING message.

(b) Sticky compaction decisions: once a message is removed, truncated, or
    stubbed, that decision must never be re-derived or reversed on a later
    call. This is what keeps the prefix byte-stable across calls where
    history only grew by a turn or two, instead of continuously re-deriving
    (and potentially shifting) the whole compaction decision every call.

The most important test here is `test_prefix_stability_regression` -- this is
the test that would have caught the original bug (notice at index 1 + fully
re-derived compaction on every call).
